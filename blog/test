To test the login 
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/blog/api/login/ -d "username=osama" -d "password=osm12345" 

If the user is already logged in, there's no need to provide the username and password again. Instead, you can simply send a POST request to the logout endpoint without any additional parameters.

curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/blog/api/logout_view/
